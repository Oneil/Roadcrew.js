Roadcrew.js
===================

Roadcrew.js is a simple JavaScript snippet which allows
"page transitions" like in jQuery mobile. It means,
you can have multiple divs in a HTML5 document which
serve as "pages". Roadcrew.js allows you to navigate
between them. 

It does not allow you to include divs via Ajax.

Currently there is only one transition animation: fadeIn.
This is a jQuery animation. Because Roadcrew.js is so 
simple, you can easily remove this animation or
add your own.

Roadcrew.js has been developed because jQuery mobile
was very slow on my mobiles. The only feature I would
miss was the page feature, which is now available with
Roadcrew.js.

My current stack for HTML5 dev on mobile is now:

- Apache Cordova (was Phonegap)
- Roadcrew.js
- Promise.js (https://github.com/stackp/promisejs) for AJAX (see also: http://bit.ly/HbKRU4)
- Twitter Bootstrap
- jQuery

I plan to remove jQuery in favour to Zepto.js: http://zeptojs.com/
In other terms: Roadcrew.js will have Zepto.js support too.
Plans are to keep jQuery support for this library.
